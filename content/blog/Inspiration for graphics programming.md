Learning the low-level relationships between math and visualizations...It is a different way of seeing the patterns that exist.

What struck me the most last year was the graphics in Alexander’s Whitleys’ “Anti-Body”

The ghostly way they interface with the dancers’ motions, the beauty of the moments in the performances as the dancer and digital moved together.

I also like the graphics of performances e.g. VJing I think!! Also TeamLabs. The importance of these visuals for creating compelling spaces and transcendent events.
  

Also what Alida Sun is doing… [https://www.instagram.com/alidasun/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/alidasun/?hl=en)

And without using expensive sensor hardware!! Just a laptop!! IT’S POSSIBLE!

Maybe I should look into nodes-based programming? Similar to TouchDesigner and other interfaces in Unreal and Unity.

Okay but actually shaders!! Just start.
