title: "Mediating sensation"
---

From Elise Co (Beyond Pixels)
* "Computers are not there to create ambience; we want them to perform tasks and relay data, so they (usually) cannot be formless blobs with indecipherable pulsation."
* "Much of what is so enticing about natural phenomena – the mystery, the unpredictability – is contrary to what we want from machines."
* "I think we should start to think of machines less as boxes of practicality and more as a generic control mechhanisms for mediating all kinds of interactions and stimuli."
* "As machines become more ubiquitous and appropriate for less task-oriented situations, there will be a lot of room for inputs or outputs that are not as exact or efficient but appeal to a much broader sensory range or provide a more evocative experience"
