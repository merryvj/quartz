title: "When computers disappear"
---

Excerpt from [[Live coding]] book:
"The invisibility here operates like ideology, where lived experience appears increasingly programmed, and we hardly notice how ideology is working on us.11 If we follow this logic, then we do not use computers; they use us. Along with the disappearance of the computer, as one of the tenets of contemporary interface design established through technical programs of pervasive and ubiquitous computing, artist Olia Lialina identifies that the user is disappearing as wellâ€”both the phenomenon and the term. This is a problem for her (and us) in as much as Big Tech wants computers to be invisible so our experience of using them becomes seemingly natural"
- Reminds me of McLuhan ("medium is the message/MASSAGE")
