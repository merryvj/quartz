Music and dance are art forms of change over time: wavelengths, movements...
But programming? Languages like Java and C know no such thing as time, at least not inherently.
[ChucK] (https://chuck.stanford.edu/) is a programming language for sound and precisely controlling the flow of time

Elements unfolding, emerging, disappearing, transitioning into the next scene. When I talk about animations in UI, I say "choreography". Those interactions are rehearsed, pre-written in the software and unchanged when run.  

What if it's about the program/software itself changing over time ([[Live coding]])? Will AI tools make those interfaces that adapt themselves a reality? Each iteration is slightly different depending on who is using it. It's difficult to point at what specifically is the software itself and what is the extension of the user it's molded by/for/molding ([[When computers disappear]])
