title: "(WIP) Learning GLSL journey"
---

## Choosing motivation

Why learn GLSL? For me, it started with audiovisual performance. To be able to create expressive visual experiences unbounded by limitations of WYSIWYG software. The idea of tinkering with the process of producing the outcomes, which leads to infinite possibilities, is like magic. I find it more compelling and fun than using an AI tool like Midjourney. There's more room to explore the unexpected, rather than trying to write prompts that converge on a specific result. 

## Phase 1: Starting with basics
- How GPUs and shaders generally work 
- Making basic shapes appear (circles, boxes, lines)
- Applying colors
- Simple animations

Learning from video tutorials that make a simple project, and introduces the use of several techniques. Then using bookofshader sections to understand details.

Shaders I made at this point (code included):


## Phase 2:  Math time!
Now leaning heavily into book of shaders, but also using functions copy-and-pasted is also fair!
- Shaping patterns (step and smoothstep)
- Matrices 
- Random and noise
