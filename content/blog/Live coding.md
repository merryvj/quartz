"The code allows the audience to view the choreographer and the performer’s mind, process and interpretations. Not just their bodies."

For live coder Sarah Groff Hennigh Palermo, “This way of computing . . . helps me ‘unthink’ the engineering I do as my day job. It allows for a relationship with computers where they are more like plants, rewarding cultivation and experimentation.”

"The invisibility here operates like ideology, where lived experience appears increasingly programmed, and we hardly notice how ideology is working on us.11 If we follow this logic, then we do not use computers; they use us. Along with the disappearance of the computer, as one of the tenets of contemporary interface design established through technical programs of pervasive and ubiquitous computing, artist Olia Lialina identifies that the user is disappearing as well—both the phenomenon and the term. This is a problem for her (and us) in as much as Big Tech wants computers to be invisible so our experience of using them becomes seemingly natural"

"But a live coding musician is like an improvising composer, able to transform the whole structure of the piece with a few keystrokes"

"Music and dance are art forms concerned with movement over time, from fluctuating waveforms or movements making up individual actions to sequences of actions and the rhythmic patterns in which they play out. Everybody knows that performances can be captured digitally, but it is not so widely understood (or even accepted by computer scientists) that computers and algorithms are fundamentally concerned with time or that using computers and making software is a kind of performance in itself. In these terms, live coding helps us to gain new insights about what software can be."
