This is a haphazard log of ideas pieced together from art, media, and technology. What are ways that technology can [[Mediating sensation | mediate new experiences]]? Where are the links to [[Live coding | live performance]]? 

These are curiosities that currently lead me to basic explorations of [[Graphics programming]]. I hope to follow these perspectives to eventually create spaces, events, memories...that revel in the delight of art, use new mediums to communicate in embodied ways, and tap into the technological principle of "scale" so that more people can enjoy the vibrancy. Hand-waviness and nebulous words aside, I JUST WANT TO MAKE AND SHARE WONDERFUL THINGS!! :D
